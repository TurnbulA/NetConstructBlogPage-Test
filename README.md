# NetConstructBlogPage-Test

After completing task 1 (displaying the main body of the Blogs) and 2 (displaying the comments). I became stuck on the third task. I managed to have the form send the data to the post method CreateComment found in the home controller file. The main issue I found was then adding the new data to the json file. I researched methods to do this which where unsuccessful and have left commented out code showing my attempt at a solution. Normally after being stuck on a problem like this I would then go to a more senior developer to ask for assistance. This is my first time working with JSON this way and I hope that I have been able to show my ablity to learn new methods which I have really enjoyed doing.
